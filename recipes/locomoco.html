        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This amazing Hawaiian comfort food classic is made by topping rice with a fried burger, which is then smothered with a rich, brown gravy and finished with a fried egg. 
            Seriously, how did it take until 1949 for someone to think of this combination? 
            We all get hangry sometimes, so whether you're a broke student or an older professional who just wishes you were, this cheap, filling bowl of goodness is the perfect solution. 
            Garnish with green onions. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (4 ounce) patties ground beef </li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season patties with salt, pepper, and cayenne.</li>
            <li>Whisk beef stock, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, sesame oil, ketchup, sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patty in the hot skillet until a browned crust forms on the bottom, about 5 minutes. 
                Flip; toss in green onions and cook the other side until both beef and onions are browned, 4 to 5 minutes more. Remove patty and most of the green onions to a plate.</li>
        </ol>
